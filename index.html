			<p>You're so mad at him all over again, and just like before, you have no justifiable reason to be. 
			<p>You're lowercase, he's capitalized, and that's why it's so complicated. Humans are so malleable—you can create a new identity for yourself at any time. 
			<p>But if you already have a fundamental personality, a fundamental <b>You</b>,
			<p>singular, 
			</br>Capitalized, 
			<p>then everyone else has to miss out on something potentially great. 
			<p>And you are...
			<e></br>And you are...</e>
			<p>Angry. Or frustrated. Disappointed, in who you don't know, yourself or him or them, they, the ever-vague and elusive fork in the road that tips the blame right over the counter with eyes wide shut.

			<p>He knew, in a sense, that this second form was different from the others. Different from the way Shade was, when he tried to pull too far and too deep for power that he hadn't quite made his own yet. At that point, at least, it had been a warning—grasp for too much, too eagerly, and you'll fall in your attempts to scrabble for purchase. 
			<p>The spark hadn't responded to him during those times. It remained, seated comfortably in his heart, for him to return to his senses. Like it knew that Nova was not who, or what, Seven truly was, and Halation had but one master now. It didn't recognize Seven's Nova form as worthy—but it didn't abandon him, either. 
			<p>It just...waited. Sleeping, almost. Locking itself away until he had the right shine to his heart to guide it back to wakefulness.
			<p>Shade form was...not the same, exactly. The spark recognized it as the creature known as <i>Seven</i>, its master, and allowed itself to be utilized. 
			<p>He didn't know how he felt about that. 
			<p>It wasn't like it was an unconscious decision, either—Seven knew what he was doing. It was a choice. He just—it was just desperation. And maybe a little <f>frustration</f>. Annoyance? He just didn't—
			<p>He didn't want to return to that darkness, again, after how much effort he'd already expelled going forward. 
			<p>It was something he'd become keenly aware of ever since he'd first set foot at his Awakening, before he'd even known what it was. Before he'd even known what a <i>spark</i> was, much less the kind of power it held. He just knew...if he screwed up badly enough, fatally enough, he'd find himself there with the ability to step back a few paces in linear time and...start again. 
			<p>But there had been something that started to nag at the back of his mind somewhere down the road, frustration paving the way to anger and maybe a little hate because he'd have to start the <i>whole thing all over again—</i>
			<p>So, he'd learned. A bit. 
			<p>In the beginning, the darkness was just that—Darkness. It could not attack, could not move, and the only thing that existed within that abyssal stasis was an option to forfeit, or go back to a point earlier in time. 
			<p>But once he'd jumped through the cracks left by his friends, he'd learned...something. At some point. 
			<p>In the void with only the ringing chime of his heart in limbo, he'd managed to find a way to compartmentalize his existence and tweak it—<i>just</i> a bit. Reflect on it. Consider his state and maybe manipulate the items Seven had on his person for <i>when</i> he went back. He could start from his end's beginning.
			<p>It was a...mixed blessing.
			<p>Sure, it was useful, but also <i>frustrating.</i> Being able to constantly throw himself right back to the start. He couldn't deny that it made him sloppy at times, and sloppy meant throwing himself at it again, and again, and <f>again</f>, and if he could just - get - passed - <i>this—</i>
			<p>Desperation. 
			<p>And a little anger. 
			<div class="g">(Senna's voice, firm yet fleeting, pressing against a memory </br>that couldn't quite belong to him alone, "What is darkness but anger </br>and hate?")</div>
			<p>It left him feeling a little sick, if he thought about it for too long. So he didn't—there were bigger, more pressing matters anyway, and at the end of the day, he was still the same old <i>Seven</i> that he'd always been. 
			<p><div class="g">(he doesn't want to think about what that could mean, either. </div>
			<div class="j">so he doesn't.)</div>
